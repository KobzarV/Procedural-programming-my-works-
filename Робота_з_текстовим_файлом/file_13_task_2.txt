Lincoln warned the South in his Inaugural Address: 
"In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, and not in mine, 
is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail you.... 
You have no oath registered in Heaven to destroy the government, while 
I shall have the most solemn one to preserve, protect and defend it."
Lincoln thought secession illegal, and was willing to use force 
to defend Federal law and the Union. When Confederate batteries 
fired on Fort Sumter and forced its surrender, he called on the 
states for 75,000 volunteers. Four more slave states joined the 
Confederacy but four remained within the Union. The Civil War had begun.
The son of a Kentucky frontiersman, Lincoln had to struggle for 
a living and for learning. Five months before receiving his 
party's nomination for President, he sketched his life:
"I was born Feb. 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. 
My parents were both born in Virginia, of undistinguished 
families--second families, perhaps I should say. My mother, 
who died in my tenth year, was of a family of the name of Hanks.... 
My father ... removed from Kentucky to ... Indiana, in my eighth year.... 
It was a wild region, with many bears and other wild animals still in the woods. 
There I grew up.... Of course when I came of age I did not know much. 
Still somehow, I could read, write, and cipher ... but that was all."
